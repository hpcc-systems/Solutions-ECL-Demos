## ECL Training Samples

ECL stands for "Enterprise Control Language" and it is the language you use when
working with HPCC Systems' big data technology.  More information on the
technology can be found at https://hpccsystems.com.  The platform's Open Source
repo is at https://github.com/hpcc-systems/HPCC-Platform.


### [Taxi Data](Taxi)

This data is primarily New York City cab fare information from the Yellow Cab
Company.  The timeframe of the data is Jan. 2015 thru Jun. 2016.  It is
approximately 35GB in size, containing a little over 215M rows.

In addition to the taxi fare data, we have collected weather information for the
same time period.  This weather data can be used to augment the fare data to
perhaps draw correlations between taxi use and how nice the weather is (e.g.
more people use taxis during inclement weather).
